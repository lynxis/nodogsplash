Welcome to Nodogsplash's documentation!
=======================================

Nodogspash is a high performance, small footprint Captive Portal,
offering by default a simple splash page restricted Internet connection, yet incorporates an API that allows the creation of sophisticated authentication applications.

It was derived originally from the codebase of the Wifi Guard Dog project.

Nodogsplash is released under the GNU General Public License.
